# Tic Tac Toe

A plain JS project. Using the [factory pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#factorypatternjavascript) and the [module pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript) to organize the code.

This is a complete and an awesome **_Tic Tac Toe_** game, fully optimized for _desktop_ and _mobile_, with a great design and all the necessary features you could think of (check [Features](#features) for more details).

**_Artificial Intelligence_**: To create the **_AI_** for this game I used the [Alpha-Beta Pruning](https://www.javatpoint.com/ai-alpha-beta-pruning) algorithm, which is an optimization technique for the [Mini-Max](https://www.javatpoint.com/mini-max-algorithm-in-ai) algorithm, a recursive or backtracking algorithm which is used in decision-making and game theory.
